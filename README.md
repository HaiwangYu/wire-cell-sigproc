# Wire Cell Signal Processing

This Wire Cell package provides nodes which apply processing of the
digitized wire waveforms.  Operations include:

* determine baseline to subtract
* determine noise threshold
* application of baseline and threshold
* common mode noise removal
* deconvolution of detector response
